Hi [Manager Name],

I need some Hostinger server details to deploy the food delivery app to mymondas.app. 

Could you please provide the following information from your Hostinger account?

=== FTP/SFTP ACCESS ===
1. Log into Hostinger hPanel
2. Go to: Files → FTP Accounts
3. Share:
   - FTP Host: (usually ftp.mymondas.app or an IP)
   - FTP Username: 
   - FTP Password: 

=== DATABASE DETAILS ===
1. Go to: Databases → MySQL Databases (or PostgreSQL)
2. If database exists, share:
   - Database Host: (usually localhost)
   - Database Name: 
   - Database Username: 
   - Database Password: 
3. If no database exists, please create one and share the details

=== HOSTING PLAN ===
1. Go to: Account → Subscription
2. Share: Plan Type (Shared/VPS/Cloud)

=== SSH ACCESS (Optional) ===
1. Go to: Advanced → SSH Access
2. Share: SSH Status (Enabled/Disabled)

OR

You can add me as a collaborator with full access:
1. Go to: Account → Collaborators
2. Add my email with full access

Once I have these details, I can deploy the app and get it live on mymondas.app!

Thanks!
